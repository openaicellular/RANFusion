# Wellcom to RAN Fusion

## Overview

Welcome to the RANFusion (RAN) Simulator! This simple tool is designed to simulate the behavior and performance of 5G networks like Handover between the sectors. Our simulator offers a detailed framework to test and analyze various components of 5G technology.
This is the sample result for running 10 UE and see the logs:
